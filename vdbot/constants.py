Our goal is to have a safe space for developers to come chat, mess around, and learn from each other. Before you start, we ask that you take a look at the rules section and familiarize yourself with it.

You can find the rules here: <#830577877761654794>

If you are a mod creator or asset creator and would like access to the dev/asset chats, head to <#830561120456278078> and react with the role you want to receive!

You also have the ability to use some commands in the server. The following commands are available to all members:

**!define <word>** - Define a word quickly and easily

**!howdoi <query>** - Find code snippets from StackOverflow

**!wheretostart** - Find links to the Valheim Modding Wiki Easily

**!mod <query>** - Search for Mods on Thunderstore and Nexusmods
